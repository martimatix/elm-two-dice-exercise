# Elm Two Dice Example

This is my attempt at solving the two dice exercise in [Section 2.2.1](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/effects/random.html) of the Elm tutorial.

My solution draws heavily on  [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37227421/how-do-i-add-a-second-die-to-this-elm-effects-example) Stack Overflow question. Thanks guys.
